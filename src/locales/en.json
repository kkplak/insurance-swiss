  "healthInsuranceDescriptionLong": "Health insurance is a critical financial tool designed to cover medical and surgical costs. Depending on the type of health insurance plan, either the insured pays out-of-pocket and is later reimbursed, or the insurer makes payments directly to the provider. Health insurance policies typically cover doctor visits, hospital stays, preventive care, and prescription medications. Some plans may also offer coverage for mental health services, vision, and dental care. Having health insurance is essential as it helps mitigate the high costs associated with healthcare, ensuring individuals and families receive necessary medical care without excessive financial burden.",
  "lifeInsuranceDescriptionLong": "Life insurance is a contract between an individual and an insurance company, where the insurer agrees to pay a designated beneficiary a specified amount of money upon the insured person's death. This type of insurance provides financial protection and peace of mind, ensuring that loved ones are financially secure after the insured's death. Life insurance can cover various expenses, including funeral costs, outstanding debts, mortgage repayments, and everyday living expenses. Some policies also offer living benefits, which may be accessible under certain conditions, providing additional financial support during the insured's lifetime.",
  "carInsuranceDescriptionLong": "Car insurance is a policy purchased by vehicle owners to minimize costs associated with car accidents or vehicle damage. It covers various incidents such as collisions, theft, vandalism, and damage caused by natural disasters. Car insurance typically includes liability coverage, which pays for damage or injury you cause to others, and may also offer comprehensive and collision coverage for your own vehicle. Additionally, policies may cover medical payments, personal injury protection, and uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage. Having car insurance is essential for financial protection and legal compliance, ensuring drivers can cover unexpected expenses related to their vehicles.",
  "houseInsuranceDescriptionLong": "House insurance, also known as homeowners insurance, provides financial protection against damage to your home and personal belongings due to covered events such as fire, theft, vandalism, and natural disasters. It also offers liability coverage if someone is injured on your property or if you cause damage to someone else's property. House insurance policies typically cover the structure of the home, personal property, additional living expenses if you need to temporarily relocate, and liability coverage. Having house insurance is crucial for protecting one of your largest investments and ensuring financial stability in the event of unforeseen events.",
  "lawProtectionDescriptionLong": "Legal protection insurance, also known as legal expenses insurance, covers costs associated with legal expenses incurred by the insured in legal disputes. This type of insurance can help cover attorney fees, court costs, and other legal expenses in various situations such as employment disputes, contract issues, personal injury claims, and family matters. Legal protection insurance provides access to legal advice and representation, reducing the financial burden of legal proceedings and ensuring individuals can seek justice and protect their rights without worrying about high costs.",
  "petInsuranceDescriptionLong": "Pet insurance helps cover the costs of veterinary care for your pets, ensuring they receive necessary treatment without causing financial strain. This type of insurance typically covers accidents, illnesses, surgeries, and routine care such as vaccinations and preventive treatment. Some policies may also offer coverage for hereditary and congenital conditions, dental care, and alternative therapies. Pet insurance allows pet owners to focus on their pets' health and well-being rather than the costs associated with veterinary visits, providing peace of mind and financial support when their furry friends need it most.",

Then, 10% of the remaining amount: CHF 10,000 - CHF 300 = CHF 9,700. 10% of CHF 9,700 is CHF 970, but the maximum amount from the remaining 10% is CHF 700.
