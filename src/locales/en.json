    "healthInsuranceDescriptionLong": "Health insurance is a critical financial tool designed to cover medical and surgical costs. Depending on the type of health insurance plan, either the insured pays out-of-pocket and is later reimbursed, or the insurer makes direct payments to the provider. Health insurance policies typically cover doctor visits, hospital stays, preventive care, and prescription medications. Some plans may also offer coverage for mental health services, vision care, and dental care. Having health insurance is essential because it helps mitigate the high costs associated with healthcare, providing individuals and families with the necessary medical care without excessive financial burden.",
    "lifeInsuranceDescriptionLong": "Life insurance is an agreement between an individual and an insurance company, in which the insurer agrees to pay a designated beneficiary a specified sum of money upon the death of the insured person. This type of insurance provides financial protection and peace of mind by ensuring that loved ones are financially secured after the insured's death. Life insurance can cover various expenses, including funeral costs, outstanding debts, mortgage repayments, and daily living expenses. Some policies also offer living benefits, which may be available under certain conditions, providing additional financial support during the insured's lifetime.",
    "carInsuranceDescriptionLong": "Car insurance is a policy purchased by vehicle owners to minimize the costs associated with being involved in a car accident or vehicle damage. It covers various events such as collisions, theft, vandalism, and damages caused by natural disasters. Car insurance typically includes liability coverage, which covers damages or injuries you cause to others, and may also offer comprehensive and collision coverage for your own vehicle. Additionally, policies may cover medical payments, personal injury protection, and coverage against uninsured/underinsured drivers. Having car insurance is essential for financial protection and legal compliance, ensuring that drivers can cover unexpected expenses related to their vehicles.",
    "houseInsuranceDescriptionLong": "Home insurance, also known as homeowners insurance, provides financial protection against damage to your home and personal belongings as a result of covered events such as fire, theft, vandalism, and natural disasters. It also offers liability coverage in case someone is injured on your property or you cause damage to someone else's property. Home insurance policies typically cover the structure of the house, personal property, additional living expenses if you need to temporarily relocate, and liability. Having home insurance is crucial for protecting one of your biggest investments and ensuring financial stability in the event of unforeseen circumstances.",
    "lawProtectionDescriptionLong": "Legal protection insurance, also known as legal expenses insurance, covers the costs associated with legal expenses incurred by the insured in the event of legal disputes. This type of insurance can help cover attorney fees, court costs, and other legal expenses in various situations such as employment disputes, contractual issues, personal injury claims, and family matters. Legal protection insurance provides access to legal advice and representation, reducing the financial burden associated with legal proceedings and ensuring that individuals can seek justice and protect their rights without worrying about high costs.",
    "petInsuranceDescriptionLong": "Pet insurance helps cover the costs of veterinary care for your pets, ensuring they receive necessary treatment without causing financial strain. This type of insurance typically covers accidents, illnesses, surgeries, and routine care such as vaccinations and preventive treatments. Some policies may also offer coverage for hereditary and congenital conditions, dental care, and alternative therapies. Pet insurance allows pet owners to focus on the health and well-being of their furry friends rather than on the expenses associated with veterinary visits, providing peace of mind and financial support when their pets need it the most.",

It must be purchased within 90 days of starting work in Switzerland. It covers essential medical services, such as doctor visits, hospital treatment in a general ward, prescription medications, and emergency care. Everyone can choose their insurer from many available companies that offer the same services as defined by law. The basic insurance can be changed annually until the end of November.",

      "p8": "Example: After a 5-day hospital stay, we receive a bill of CHF 10,000. Assuming our deductible is CHF 300, we first pay the amount of our deductible, which is CHF 300. Then we pay 10% of the remaining amount. The remaining amount is CHF 10,000 - CHF 300 = CHF 9,700. 10% of CHF 9,700 is CHF 970, but remember that the maximum amount for the 10% share is CHF 700. So, CHF 970 is capped at CHF 700. Adding CHF 300 + CHF 700 equals CHF 1000, which is the amount we have to pay out-of-pocket."

      "title": "Insurance Model",
      "p": "The insurance model refers to the way you access medical services under your health insurance.

      "p4": "Telmed – You first contact a telephone center, which directs you to the appropriate doctor.",
